1. Data Collection

The first step involves gathering historical user data from past ad campaigns. The dataset typically includes:
Demographic features: Age, Gender, Area Income, City.
Behavioral features: Daily Time Spent on Site, Daily Internet Usage, Ad Topic Interest.
Target variable: Whether the user clicked on the ad (1) or not (0).

2. Data Preprocessing

Data cleaning and transformation are performed to prepare the dataset for modeling:
Handling missing values and outliers.
Converting categorical variables into numerical form using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Normalizing or standardizing numeric features like income and usage time to bring them to a uniform scale.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (commonly 70%-30% or 80%-20%).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps in understanding relationships between variables and the target output:
Visualizing correlations between user attributes and click behavior.
Detecting patterns such as whether younger users or high internet usage users are more likely to click.
Identifying which features most influence ad engagement.

4. Model Building (Logistic Regression)

A logistic regression model is trained using the processed data.
It uses a sigmoid function to estimate the probability that a user will click on an ad.
The model outputs values between 0 and 1, which are then classified as “likely to click” or “unlikely to click”.

5. Model Evaluation

Performance is assessed using key classification metrics:
Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
Precision: How many predicted clicks were actual clicks.
Recall: How many actual clicks were correctly identified.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

6. Business Implementation

The trained model is integrated into ad targeting systems to identify high-probability users. This enables optimized ad spend, higher CTR, and better ROAS for clients.
